== DESCRIPTION ==

*As opposed to Klarna Checkout, Payments are standalone payment methods. Complement your existing checkout experience with a Klarna hosted widget (e.g., Pay Later, Financing or Installments).*

Choose the Klarna features you want – and only the features you want – to reduce purchase stress and improve your user experience. We have several financing and direct payment options to meet your needs, and they’re all easily integrated into your existing buying journey.

=== Pay Now (direct payments) ===
Customers who want to pay in full at checkout can do it quickly and securely with a credit/debit card.Friction-free direct purchases while maximising the value for your business thanks to guaranteed payments. If they have a Klarna account they can save their details and enjoy one-click purchases from then on.

===  Pay later (invoice) ===
Try it first, pay it later. Delayed payments for customers who like low friction purchases and to pay after delivery.

=== Slice it (installments) ===
Installment, revolving and other flexible financing plans let customers pay when they can and when they want.

=== How to Get Started ===
* [Sign up for Klarna](https://www.klarna.com/international/business/woocommerce/).
* [Install the plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/klarna-payments-for-woocommerce/) on your site. During this process you will be asked to download [Klarna Order Management](https://wordpress.org/plugins/klarna-order-management-for-woocommerce/) so you can handle orders in Klarna directly from WooCommerce.
* Get your store approved by Klarna, and start selling.

=== What's the difference between Klarna Checkout and Klarna Payments? ===
Klarna as your single payment provider keeps everything under one roof. You’ll have one agreement, one point of contact, one settlement file, one payout with __Klarna Checkout__. It only takes a single integration to deliver the full Klarna hosted checkout experience through a widget placed on your site.

__Klarna Payments__ removes the headaches of payments, for both consumers and merchants. Complement your checkout with a Klarna hosted widget located in your existing checkout which offers payment options for customers with a smooth user experience.
